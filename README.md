## Automatic Water and Ice dispensing Machine

### Introduction

The project undertaken for this term was an automatic water dispensing machine.This was done so that people can easily get water and need not to turn on the taps. The structure of the dispensing machine is the simple carboard structure where you put a glass and the water comes out from it.There is a simple modification which is done by me in this, as when the temperature is hot along with the water it also dispenses ice cubes into the glass. 

The basic concept of this is as the ultrasonic sensor detects the glass which is placed less than 3 cm away from the sensor, it activates the relay which turn on the micro air pump, the micro air pump creates the pressure inside the tube so the water comes out from the tube and water falls on the glass and if the temperature is more than 26'C, which is detected by the temperature sensor, the servo motor activates and the flap is released by servo motor a couple of ice cubes drop in.
